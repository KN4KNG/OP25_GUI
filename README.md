# OP25_GUI
Graphical User Interface for OP25

This is a personal project that I have made with tkinter to allow for a raspbery pi w/ 7" touchscreen to interface with OP25 in a mobile/portable envirroment. 

Currently there is support for 20 sites. 

You will need to create a separate .tsv file and name the in the manner which you will use in the commands. 

Once that is completed, rename the button labels and update the commands with the desired site .tsv.

I am currently looking into creating a set up file to allow for ease of creation of your own GUI without having to alter any code. I will work on this as time allows. 

If you have any interest in assisting with this project, please feel free to reach out to me.

73's and happy scanning.
